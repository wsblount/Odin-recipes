<h3>Best big-batch cookies</h3>

<p>This recipe made perfectly soft chocolate chip cookies. The dough is made with two packets of instant pudding mix — an ingredient I had never seen anyone use in cookie dough — which seems to give the cookies a softer, more bakery-style texture. Think of these as the "soft-baked" style cookies that have a somewhat pliable, bendy texture.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
    <li>2 cups butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 1/2 packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>2 packages instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    <li>2 cups chopped walnuts (Optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Sift together flour and baking soda in a medium bowl, set aside.</li>
    <li>Cream together butter, brown sugar, and white sugar in a large bowl. Beat in instant pudding mix until blended. Stir in eggs and vanilla.</li>
    <li>Add flour mixture to the butter mixture until it's well incorporated. Fold in chocolate chips and nuts.</li>
    <li>Drop cookies by rounded spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.</li>
    <li>Bake in batches in the preheated oven until the edges are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes, switching racks halfway through.</li>
</ol>
