<h3>One-Pan White Cheddar Mac and Cheese</h3>

<p>If you can make boxed macaroni and cheese, you can make this one-pan, scratch-made mac and cheese! The bacon, chives, and crispy bread crumb topping add some great extra flavor and texture.</p>

<div class="ingredients">
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
</div>    
<ul>
    <li>16 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
    <li>2 1/2 cups milk</li>
    <li>2 cups water</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 cup margarine</li>

    <li>1 1/2 cups shredded white Cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese, divide</li>

<h2>Steps:</h2>
</div>
<ol>
    <li>Combine macaroni, milk, water, garlic salt, and salt in a Dutch oven on a stovetop over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently so noodles don't stick to the pan, until noodles are soft and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove pot from heat and stir in margarine and pepper until melted. Stir in Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese until melted.</li>
    <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
    <li>Top pasta with bread crumbs, remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, and bacon bits.</li>
    <li>Place Dutch oven under the broiler until topping is lightly browned and crispy, 1 to 3 minutes. Top with chives and serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
